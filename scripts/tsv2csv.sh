# Convert TSV to CSV
# by replacing tabs with commas
# after quoting the fields which contain commas or double-quotes
# (double quotes inside quoted fields are doubled for escaping)
#
# Usage:
#   tsv2csv.sh < input.tsv > output.csv
#
# Input:
#   lines separated with tabs, on the standard input
#
# Output:
#   lines separated with commas, with fields quoted when needed,
#   on the standard output

# a TAB character
tab='	'

# a comma character
comma=','

# a double quote character
quote='"'

# Convert one line of TSV to CSV
#
# Parameter:
#   $1 - string, the line of TSV to convert
#
# Output:
#   the line converted to CSV, printed to standard output
